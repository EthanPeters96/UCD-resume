# Ethan's Resume

### Welcome to my resume!

This project is a portfolio for a Full Stack Developer.

The resume includes educational background and work experience. It is a living document, that i will regularly update it as I complete more courses and changes job positions.

The link to my GitHub profile shows that this resume is geared towards technical roles, as it allows potential employers or collaborators to view my repositories and assess my coding skills.

The website includes the following sections:

Header: The header contains my name and my title. It also includes a navigation menu with four items: Home, Resume, Contact, and Download. Each menu item is associated with an icon and a link to a different page or resource.

Home: This leads back to the main page of the website.

Resume: This leads to a page detailing my work experience, skills, and education.

Contact: This leads to a page with contact information or a form to reach out to me.

Download: This link allows users to download my CV as a PDF.
